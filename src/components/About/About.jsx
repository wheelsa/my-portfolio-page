        <p>
          As a veteran, I have always tried to pursue work that is purpose driven. 
          Since leaving the Army that's taken the form of working for technology companies that empower others & drive human progress. 
          I've been successful in this endeavor, helping companies achieve their ROI goals. I am able to work in complex cross functional environments, 
          I have a bias for action while managing competing priorities and I believe in being a lifelong Learner with a growth mindset.
          Something had been missing though. I realized that I wanted to do more then talk about products, I wanted to build them. I wanted to change the world directly with a hard skillset.
          This led me to take the Full Stack Development Bootcamp at Devpoint labs to make the transition to software development. I am not on a mission to build purpose driven software, making peoples lives better one keystroke at a time.
